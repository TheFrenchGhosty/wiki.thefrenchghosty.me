This modlist is partially based on a personal modlist of 100 mods I originally made back in early 2017 and on the officially recommended mods on the Frackin' Universe wiki ( https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Recommended_mods ).

The result is an highly curated modlist focused on [Frackin' Universe](https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) (and the mods they officially recommend), it is kept reasonably small, because [Frackin' Universe](https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a massive mod, that already include features from other mods, it even include some independent mods that were completely "merged" with it: https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Included

This modlist is made for a play-through in the [Casual difficulty](https://starbounder.org/Difficulty_Mode), if you want to play in any other difficulty, you won't need "Hunger Enabler for Casual Mode" (but having it won't hurt).

Links to the Steam Workshop are provided, because (sadly) some mods are only available there.

All mods can be downloaded from it (with [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD)), but you have to own the game on Steam, most of the mods include download links outside of the Steam Workshop, and the remaining one can be downloaded with the various web services allowing users to download Steam Workshop mods.
