Bibliogram's docker image is \"bad\", it should be able to run, but for a production setup (like the PussTheCat.org instance ) it's not \"good enough\", so it has to run on \"metal\". Explanation of the janky setup The deployment: My Bibliogram instance is setup with bibliogram-updater (because the nodejs version shipped by my distribution breaks Bibliogram), run in a screen session. Bibliogram has a tendency to crash (it's rare but it happens), it's run in a while loop that automatically restart it: while true; do ./run.fish; done . The big, bad bug: After being run for around 1 month, Bibliogram will bug out, and it will \"make\" NginX create dozens/hundreds of child process (until the CPU is pinned at 100%), a \"quick\" fix when it happens is to restart Bibliogram. Bibliogram has to be restarted, and to be safe, I restart it every 6 hours. So how to make it restart then? Well, we have a loop that restart the instance when it breaks... so... we just have to break the instance. How to break the instance? There's a cool tool that I recently discovered called pkill it kills a process named exactly in a certain way (because I can't just killall node , other stuff run via node). So to have it automatically restart every 6 hours... we just make a cron that pkill the Bibliogram node process ( node server.js ), and because bibliogram-updater doesn't check if the node process is still alive (or not)... we also kill the bibliogram-updater scripts ( run.fish ). This is the cronjobs: 0 */6 * * * pkill -f \"node server.js\" 0 */6 * * * pkill -f \"run.fish\" Conclusion Obviously, as you can see it's really janky, and I ideally would like to run Bibliogram via docker... but as a janky way to have a good and stable instance (with almost 100% uptime)... it works, and that's what matters! In the end, if it works, and if it can be maintained, it's fine ( famous last words ).","title":"Bibliogram's Janky Setup"},{"location":"archive/bibliogram-janky-setup/#bibliograms-janky-setup","text":"","title":"Bibliogram's Janky Setup"},{"location":"archive/bibliogram-janky-setup/#why","text":"Bibliogram's docker image is \"bad\", it should be able to run, but for a production setup (like the PussTheCat.org instance ) it's not \"good enough\", so it has to run on \"metal\".","title":"Why?"},{"location":"archive/bibliogram-janky-setup/#explanation-of-the-janky-setup","text":"","title":"Explanation of the janky setup"},{"location":"archive/bibliogram-janky-setup/#the-deployment","text":"My Bibliogram instance is setup with bibliogram-updater (because the nodejs version shipped by my distribution breaks Bibliogram), run in a screen session.

This \"guide\" is just a big list of great software/providers to dig into, the idea is that this is the information I would like to have seen 4 years ago: me from 4 years ago just wanted a list of good things to dig into: this is a list of good things to dig into. Threat model: This guide is focused on a specific threat model : avoiding Big Tech company , avoiding companies with ties to law enforcements/government agencies/governments (when possible), avoiding companies with double standard/bad privacy practices. License: The content of this guide is released under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 to everyone, except the current, past and future team members of privacyguides org and privacytools io (or any future domain owned/controlled/related by or to them), reuse is allowed following this license, as long as the content doesn't end up on privacyguides org, privacytools io (or any future domain owned/controlled/related by or to them) and any provider that isn't recommended in this guide. Why? This guide has been created because privacyguides org and privacytools io made awful decisions and have awful recommendations. There's also various internal issues at privacyguides org between their own team members . Some examples of awful decisions I contested: Removal of LineageOS: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/294#issuecomment-988092870 Removal of Posteo: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/369#issuecomment-988094653 Removal of CanvasBlocker: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/259#issuecomment-988097091 Removal of Ubuntu Touch: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/253#issuecomment-988099275 Removal of 7zip: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/258#issuecomment-988104029 The \"Do not use\" category include things recommended by privacyguides org, that, as the name suggest, you shouldn't use. Some community feedback about what privacyguides org has become: About the removal of a lot of good recommendations \"There are so many on this list that shouldn't have been removed. Cookie AutoDelete, multi account containers, Safari, Ungoogled chromium, anti recommendation: chrome. None of it makes any sense...\" , \"This is pointed out constantly, but they just cannot care\" \"PrivacyGuides is a one-man-show @tommytran732 , without any discussion\" About the Posteo removal because of DMARC: \"Nothing to do with security or privacy. Everything to do with email server reputation.\" About the LineageOS removal: \"With this logic we should use Forest OS which is even better than Graphene. The process of installing Forest OS is simple. You just throw away all of your tech, burn your passport, and go off the grid to live in a forest as a hermit. This makes you extremely private and your devices impossible to hack.\" About the DDG Browser removal: \"Removing DDG browser and saying all iOS browsers are basically Safari with a skin (the assumption being that it\u2019s not really a meaningful difference from one to the next) but then saying use FF/FF Focus because they block trackers, doesn\u2019t make sense to me because DDG also blocks trackers (and has a better default search engine).\" About the Qwant removal (because \"In December 2020, Qwant blocked access from Japan, Romania, Taiwan, and, Turkey.I consider this to be a wicked act.\"): \"How is that a reason to remove it?\" , \"its not privacy related bruh\" About the removal of good browser addons \"I feel like there's a growing disconnect between the authors and readers and we'll eventually have another 'fork' which focuses more on the average user, who has next to no technical knowledge.\" More: https://teddit.pussthecat.org/r/PrivacyGuides/comments/rbv0uh/recent_updates_to_privacyguidesorg/ Requirements All software must be open source no exception. All providers mustn't be based in the Five Eyes - USA/Canada/Australia/United Kingdom/New Zealand - or Russia. All providers shouldn't ideally be based in Switzerland (reason: Switzerland privacy died in 2018, they now basically have their own \"NSA-like\" agency , providers are just using \"Switzerland\" in their marketing because the country still has a reputation of being private - while it's not). All providers must have open source clients (or use an open standard, like IMAP/POP3 for e-mail). All providers should ideally have open source servers. All providers mustn't be invite only (sorry RiseUp and cTemplar). List Providers Cloud Storage Use: Your own self-hosted Nextcloud Any provider supported by Rclone (and just encrypt with it ) that isn't: a Big Tech company (Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft...), in a Five Eyes country - USA, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand - (BackBlaze, Dropbox, Icedrive, Mega , Box, OpenDrive, Crashplan, Wasabi, pCloud, Rsync net, and more...) or in Russia (Yandex...). Cryptee (Note: expensive, not audited, not supported by Rclone) Filen (Note: really young, not audited, not supported by Rclone) Do not use: Any other provider not supported by Rclone SpiderOak: their canary died on August 1, 2018 and they handled it as if it wasn't the case . DNS Resolver Use (if you use a VPN): The one provider by your VPN provider Use (if you don't use a VPN): Adguard (Note: Log some things: https://adguard.com/en/privacy/dns.html ) Quad9 (Note: Based in Switzerland, no log) AhaDNS (Note: Hobby project, no log) Do not use: Cloudflare: it's Cloudflare . NextDNS: USA-based UncensoredDNS: Hobby project + No privacy policy. Email provider Resource: https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/email.html Use: Posteo : Custom domains NOT supported Encryption at rest 100% open source Payment via cash, credit card ( anonymised ), bank transfer ( anonymised ) or PayPal ( anonymised ) Mailbox : Custom domains supported Encryption at rest 100% closed source Payment via cash, cash payment to bank account, credit card (not anonymised) or PayPal (not anonymised), bank transfer (not anonymised) Runbox : Custom domains supported No encryption at rest Server code is closed source, most of the client code is open source Payment via Bitcoin, cash, credit card (not anonymised), bank transfer (not anonymised) Requires a real first and last name - however they won't actually check if it's real (unless you abuse their service), you should use your real name if possible, because not doing so is technically against their ToS. Email conversation I had with them about it: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Tutanota : Custom domains supported Encryption at rest Server code is closed source Payment via credit card (not anonymised), PayPal (not anonymised), Bitcoin (through their official reseller ) or Monero (through their official reseller ) NO IMAP/POP3 , using their open source client (or web UI) is mandatory Disroot : Custom domains supported No encryption at rest 100% open source Payment via Bitcoin, FairCoin, credit card (not anonymised), bank transfer (not anonymised), Patreon (not anonymised) or PayPal (not anonymised). Hobby Project but should last (I still wouldn't recommended it as a main provider) Do not use: ProtonMail: Sketchy ( allegedly a honeypot ), in 2018, Proton, had its VPN client signed by Tesonet, an advertising company , in 2021, they helped autority by logging the IP address of a French activist, going against their marketing material, and privacy policy (More: https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/email.html#ProtonMail - Mental Outlaw's video about it: Invidious / Odysee ). StartMail: Made Startpage, and sold it to an advertising company. Search Engines Use: SearX or SearXNG (a fork of SearX) Do not use: Anything else (including Whoogle, that is just SearX but worse) Social Networks Social networks are fundamentaly not private by design, but if you have to use one, follow this list: Use: Any Fediverse-compatible project (Mastodon, diaspora*, Friendica, GNU social, Pleroma, Pixelfed...) Lemmy (Note: Projects owners/creators are heavily politically biased and use Lemmy to \"push\" their political opinions) Do not use: Anything else Social News Aggregator Use: RSS Do not use: Anything else VPN Note: A good rules is to avoid any VPN that has referals and/or advertise and/or do fake \"time limited\" sales (basically 99% of them). Use: Mullvad IVPN Do not use: ProtonVPN: like Protonmail, sketchy ( allegedly a honeypot ), in 2018, Proton, had its VPN client signed by Tesonet, an advertising company , in 2021, they helped autority by logging the IP address of a French activist, going against their marketing material, and privacy policy (More: https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/email.html#ProtonMail - Mental Outlaw's video about it: Invidious / Odysee ). Software Web Browser Use: Librewolf (Note: follow this ) Firefox properly configured (Note: it directly \"encourages\" Mozilla's behaviour ) Ungoogled Chromium Bromite Do not use: Tor Browser: it's a browser made for anonimity, not privacy Operating Systems PC Use: Any FOSS GNU/Linux distribution (except anything Ubuntu-based (that isn't Linux Mint) and Manjaro) Any FOSS BSD distrubution Do not use: Anything Ubuntu-based (that isn't Linux Mint): Made by Cannonical, a company that created and \"push\" the use of Snap, a \"packaging system\" that requires connecting to their own closed source server, and used to include advertising for Amazon. Manjaro: Sketchy, amateurish distro, awful security practice (keep packages on hold for 2 weeks \"testing purposes\" but no test is actually done), fired their treasurer because he dug too much into the finances and so much more. (More: https://github.com/arindas/manjarno - Luke Smith's video about it: Invidious / Odysee / PeerTube ).

Some examples of awful decisions I contested: Removal of LineageOS: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/294#issuecomment-988092870 Removal of Posteo: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/369#issuecomment-988094653 Removal of CanvasBlocker: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/259#issuecomment-988097091 Removal of Ubuntu Touch: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/253#issuecomment-988099275 Removal of 7zip: https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pull/258#issuecomment-988104029 The \"Do not use\" category include things recommended by privacyguides org, that, as the name suggest, you shouldn't use. Some community feedback about what privacyguides org has become: About the removal of a lot of good recommendations \"There are so many on this list that shouldn't have been removed. Cookie AutoDelete, multi account containers, Safari, Ungoogled chromium, anti recommendation: chrome. None of it makes any sense...\" , \"This is pointed out constantly, but they just cannot care\" \"PrivacyGuides is a one-man-show @tommytran732 , without any discussion\" About the Posteo removal because of DMARC: \"Nothing to do with security or privacy. Everything to do with email server reputation.\" About the LineageOS removal: \"With this logic we should use Forest OS which is even better than Graphene. The process of installing Forest OS is simple. You just throw away all of your tech, burn your passport, and go off the grid to live in a forest as a hermit. This makes you extremely private and your devices impossible to hack.\" About the DDG Browser removal: \"Removing DDG browser and saying all iOS browsers are basically Safari with a skin (the assumption being that it\u2019s not really a meaningful difference from one to the next) but then saying use FF/FF Focus because they block trackers, doesn\u2019t make sense to me because DDG also blocks trackers (and has a better default search engine).\" About the Qwant removal (because \"In December 2020, Qwant blocked access from Japan, Romania, Taiwan, and, Turkey.I consider this to be a wicked act.\"): \"How is that a reason to remove it?\" , \"its not privacy related bruh\" About the removal of good browser addons \"I feel like there's a growing disconnect between the authors and readers and we'll eventually have another 'fork' which focuses more on the average user, who has next to no technical knowledge.\" More: https://teddit.pussthecat.org/r/PrivacyGuides/comments/rbv0uh/recent_updates_to_privacyguidesorg/","title":"Why?"},{"location":"general/privacy-guide/#requirements","text":"All software must be open source no exception.
