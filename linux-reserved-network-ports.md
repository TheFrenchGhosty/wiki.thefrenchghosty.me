# Linux's Reserved Network Ports

When hosting some services, some ports should be avoided, those ports are:

**0-1023:** The "Well-Known Ports": used/reserved by system processes and core services

**32768â€“65535:** The "ephemeral ports": automatically allocated by the system to application that needs to bind to a port.

## About the "ephemeral ports":

Some distribition have a different lower values for the "ephemeral ports" (usually 49152 instead of 32768).

Some distribition have a different higher values for the "ephemeral ports" (usually 60999 or 61000 instead of 65535).

**To be safe it's easier to assume any port above 32768 is "unsafe" to use *everywhere*.**

To check what is the value on your system, you can do:

```
/usr/sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
```

or

```
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
```

The output of either of those will be `[LOWER VALUE] [HIGHER VALUE]`.
